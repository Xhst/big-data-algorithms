# Algorithms for Big Data

Collection of codes and explanations from the course on Algorithms for Big Data at Roma Tre University held by professors: Giuseppe di Battista, Fabrizio Frati, Giordano Da Lozzo.

In many application contexts huge volumes of data are produced which are used in the economic-financial, political, social and even institutional fields.
Often the data is stored in huge distributed clouds and is sometimes generated according to a continuous flow, so large as to make complete storage unfeasible.
In many cases the data pertains to entities in close relationship with each other and gives rise to massive networks of connections.
Familiar examples for such networks are biological and social networks, distribution networks, and the Web graph.
